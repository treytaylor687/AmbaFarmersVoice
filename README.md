Welcome to Team 1101's GitHub Page:


    We are working on creating an Android application for refugees in Cameroon to help aid them in better agriculture and farming techniques. Our goal is to create an application that allows our client (the admin) to upload videos locally and allow the users the ability to watch, share and download any video of their choosing. For sharing videos among others we are attempting to allow sharing via bluetoo

What we are using:


    For our app we are using Android Studio and are programming in java and react.
